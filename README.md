# About the data 
[GISAID](https://gisaid.org/) (Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza Data) is a public database for SARS-Cov-2
sequences and its variants.
◦ It is a collaborative work between the German government and a non-profit organization
(Friends of GISAID).
◦ To access the GISAID data you need to register with an educational institution email
address. Then, wait sometime until your registration gets approved.

## We have 10 sequences for hCoV-19 Delta variant in Belgium:

## We have 10 sequences for hCoV-19 Omicron variant in Belgium:

## Multiple SEquence Alignment 
•	considering that hCoV-19 Delta variant sequences are the reference sequences. To Construct a consensus sequence from the reference sequences, we used the Seaview software. The way of doing that is to get at each sequence location, the nucleotide/amino acid of the consensus sequence will be the most dominant one across all the sequences at that location.

So, the reference sequence is specified in a certain file

•	Then, we applied a multiple sequence alignment on hCoV-19 Omicron variant sequences (the case sequences).
We used the [Clustal Omega](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/jdispatcher/) technique to apply the multiple sequence alignment:
-	Clustal Omega is a new multiple sequence alignment program that uses seeded guide trees and HMM profile-profile techniques to generate alignments between three or more sequences.
